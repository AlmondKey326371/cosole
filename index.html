          <p>New to Visual Studio or coding in general? Take this step-by-step learning journey at your own pace to successfully create a simple app in any language of your choice. Letâ€™s get started! Why learn Visual Studio? Visual Studio empowers you to complete the entire development cycle in one place. For example, you can edit, debug, test, version control, and deploy to the cloud. With the diversity of features and languages in Visual Studio, you can grow from writing your first piece of code to developing in multiple project types. For example, you can build desktop and web apps with .NET, Mobile and gaming apps with C++.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Visual Studio is free for learning and individual use. First please make sure to download and install the latest version of Visual Studio. You can save installation time and disk space by selecting just the components needed. You can always incrementally add more components later at any time as needed.</p>
